##Self drive / camper van safari

Self drive hire camping vehicles have been available for hire in Tanzania for quite some time, usually landrovers or landcruiser with roof top tents and all the camping gizmo's attached, this type of self drive safari we also provide, but we are taking it one step further, Traditionally in most parts of the world vans converted to camper Vans have been the traditionally preferred method of exploring and this for the first time in Tanzania is want we would like to offer

Camper van safari's
Bringing the traditional to Tanzania.....
The beauty of this concept of exploring Tanzania, is it gives you the freedom to roam were ever the heart desires, with your "home" away from home on wheels..
Being able to pull over or pull into any campsite and have a complete setup upon arrival gives you more time to enjoy your time!!!
Sleeping inside your camper Van, gives you added safety from wild animals and people, means you don't have to pack down or pack up your camping gear as you would conventionally, just the odd table and chairs..

With your 4x4 camper van you can explore almost any where!!!!
