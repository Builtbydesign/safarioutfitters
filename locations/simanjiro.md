##SIMANJIRO AND MASAI STEP

This area albeit the most off the beaten track and one of the most neglected areas compared with our other locations, is one of our personal favorites, the land scape is savannah in some areas but mostly thorny shrub and impressive rocky outcrops, (kopjes) scoured by rock hyrax , that give great walking and high vantage points to scan for wildlife below, typically this areas consist of lesser kudu, Dikdik, Eland, stripped and spotted hyenas with the occasional wondering Oryx, a variety of bird species including vulturine guinefowl and a myriad of flora and fauna.
 
This area has been hit hard in the past by poaching and illegal charcoal, which has intern reduced the number of game and some of the larger acacia thorn tree species, however we have seen an increase of game and a reduction of coalers in the past 4-5 years due to a change in government policy, these policies only have limited leverage and all though some change can be seen it will be limited.
 
This area for us is where we would really like to implement a conservation management system that will help increase the rejuvenation of the area, our focus is on a particular area surrounded by rocky outcrops, this would be the area our camp would be set up.
 
Activites include walking, sunset and sunrise on one of the rocky outcrops and for the more adventurous a night out under the stars on the top of the kopje just on your bedroll and in your sleeping bag!!!
