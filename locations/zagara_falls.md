##ZAGARA FALLS
 
This area is situated just south of lake manyara and just outside of lake manyara biosphere reserve and nestled right up against the rift escarpment wall which creates the perfect setting for a waterfall scenario.
 
The water falls cascade of the top of the escarpment and our camp is situated at the base, this is a seasonal camp location as during the wet seasons the area is flooded, however during the dry months the location presents a perfectly sandy beached camping ground surrounded by fig trees that create ample shade, the river flows all year round but during these dry months the water level has dropped and the water is clear and refreshing for swimming, perfect for a camp chair in the water and a relaxing afternoon.
 
A village is situated close by mainly farming rice and maize, but course very little disruption to the experienceâ€¦
