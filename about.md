#about

Safari Outfitters is a family owned and managed company started in 2018, created initially to give guests the opportunity to explore in camping fashion some of the less visited wild locations in Tanzania and has expanded since to also incorporate the wider northern circuit, Tarangire, Manyara, Ngorongoro and Serengeti National Parks.
All the locations provide a unique experience and the itinerary can be tailored to each safari request.

Safari Outfitters believes in sustainable safaris, this inevitably means, engaging with community outreach programs, Orphanages and environmental programs to give back and protect the areas that exhilarate each safari, and as much as possible offset carbon footprints..
We look forward to tailoring your perfect safari experience. Join us and Explore
